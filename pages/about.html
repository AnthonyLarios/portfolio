            <p>Hello, my name is Anthony Larios. I have been learning web development for the past 2 years. I learned on my own during the first year and took Front end web development 1 and 2 at San Diego Continuing Education. If you are interested I highly recommend <a href="http://www.sdce.edu/job-training/computers/front-end-web-developer" target="_blank">taking the course</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, California. From 2006 to 2010, I attended UC Irvine and earned a bachelor's degree in Biology. During that time, I studied genetics with fruits flies, evolutionary physiology with alligators, spatial memory gene expression with mice. After college, I worked in a variety of fields, such as animal husbandry, laboratory technician, optics assembler, and retail associate.</p>
            
            <p>With my new found interest in web development and programming, I plan on creating websites while continuing to learn new subjects.</p>
